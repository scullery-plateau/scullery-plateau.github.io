# Mad-lad

Mad-Lad is a "Mad-Libs"-style wizard app for building hacks/reskins of the One-Page TTRPG "Lasers & Feelings" (created by John Harper under the creative commons license)

The goal of this app is to allow users to quickly and easily build reskins of the game to any setting, genre, story-type, to both be printable and playable within the Mad-Lad Player and Mad-Lad Storyteller apps.

Lasers & Feelings already gives the storyteller (GM) a wizard-style structure for initiating a game.
