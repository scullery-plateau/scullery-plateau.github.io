      <name>Abyssal Arcana</name>
      <text>Each time you finish a long rest, you gain the ability to cast cantrips and spells randomly determined from a short list. At 1st level, you can cast a cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can also cast a 1st-level spell. At 5th level, you can cast a 2nd_level spell. </text>
      <text>	You can cast a spell gained from this trait only once until you complete your next long rest. You can cast a cantrip gained from this trait at will, as normal. For 1st-level spells whose effect changes if cast using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you cast the spell as if using a 2nd-level slot. Spells of 2nd level are cast as if using a 2nd-_level slot. </text>
      <text>	At the end of each long rest, you lose the cantrips and spells previously granted by this feature, even if you did not cast them. You replace those cantrips and spells by rolling for new ones on the Abyssal Arcana Spells table. Roll separately for each cantrip and spell. If you roll the same spell or cantrip you gained at the end of your previous long rest, roll again until you get a different result.</text>

After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</text>

      <name>Trance</name>
      <text>Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</text>

      <name>Languages</name>
      <text>You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</text>

      <name>Shifting Seasons</name>
      <text>Eladrin are elves native to the Feywild, a realm of beauty, unpredictable emotion, and boundless magic. An eladrin is associated with one of the four seasons and has coloration reminiscent of that season, which can also affect the eladrin&#8217;s mood:</text>
      <text>
      </text>
      <text>Autumn is the season of peace and goodwill, when summer&#8217;s harvest is shared with all.</text>
      <text>Winter is the season of contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers.</text>
      <text>Spring is the season of cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment as winter&#8217;s sorrow passes.</text>
      <text>Summer is the season of boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy.</text>
      <text>
      </text>
      <text>	Some eladrin remain associated with a particular season for their entire lives, whereas other eladrin transform, adopting characteristics of a new season. When finishing a long rest, any eladrin can change their season. An eladrin might choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most closely matches the eladrin&#8217;s current emotional state. For example, an eladrin might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another eladrin could change to winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become an eladrin of spring, and fury might cause an eladrin to change to summer.

      <text>You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn't secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don't have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.</text>

      <text>Your DM assigns a goal to you&#8212;typically, one related to your character&#8217;s death. The goal must be a specific task you can complete, such as slaying an enemy or liberating an area and its people. Until you fulfill that goal, you gain the following benefits: </text>

      <text>Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</text>

      <text>You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn't secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don't have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.</text>

      <text>	At 1st level, choose one of the following options:</text>
      <text>
      </text>
      <text>Manta Glide: Your ray-like wings can slow your fall and allow you to glide. When you fall and aren&#8217;t incapacitated, you can subtract up to 100 feet from the fall when calculating falling damage, and you can move up to 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot you descend.</text>
      <text>

      <text>Nimble Climber: You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.</text>

      <text>
      </text>
      <text>	At 5th level, choose one of the following options, or choose one of the options you didn&#8217;t take at 1st level:</text>
      <text>
      </text>
      <text>Grappling Appendages: You have two special appendages growing alongside your arms. Choose whether they&#8217;re both claws or tentacles. Each of these appendages is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Immediately after hitting, you can try to grapple the target as a bonus action. These appendages can&#8217;t precisely manipulate anything and can&#8217;t wield weapons, magic items, or other specialized equipment.</text>
      <text>
      </text>
      <text>Carapace: Your skin in places is covered by a thick shell. You gain a +1 bonus to AC when you&#8217;re not wearing heavy armor.</text>
      <text>
      </text>
      <text>Acid Spit: As an action, you can spray a stream of acid from glands in your mouth, targeting one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of you. The target takes 2d10 acid damage unless it succeeds on a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 11th level (3d10) and 17th level (4d10).</text>
