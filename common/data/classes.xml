The shard shatters on impact with a blast of concussive energy.

        <name>Infuse Magic</name>
        <text>Starting at 4th level, you gain the ability to channel your artificer spells into objects for later use. When you cast an artificer spell with a casting time of 1 action, you can increase its casting time to 1 minute. If you do so and hold a nonmagical item throughout the casting, you expend a spell slot, but none of the spell&#8217;s effects occur. Instead, the spell transfers into that item for later use if the item doesn&#8217;t already contain a spell from this feature. </text>
        <text>	Any creature holding the item thereafter can use an action to activate the spell if the creature has an Intelligence score of at least 6. The spell is cast using your spellcasting ability, targeting the creature that activates the item. If the spell targets more than one creature, the creature that activates the item selects the additional targets. If the spell has an area of effect, it is centered on the item. If the spell&#8217;s range is self, it targets the creature that activates the item. </text>
        <text>	When you infuse a spell in this way, it must be used within 8 hours. After that time, its magic fades and is wasted. </text>
        <text>	You can have a limited number of infused spells at the same time. The number equals your Intelligence modifier.</text>

        <name>Mechanical Servant</name>
        <text>At 6th level, your research and mastery of your craft allow you to produce a mechanical servant. The servant is a construct that obeys your commands without hesitation and functions in combat to protect you. Though magic fuels its creation, the servant is not magical itself. You are assumed to have been working on the servant for quite some time, finally finishing it during a short or long rest after you reach 6th level. </text>
        <text>	Select a Large beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The servant uses that beast&#8217;s game statistics, but it can look however you like, as long as its form is appropriate for its statistics. It has the following modifications: </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>&#8226; It is a construct instead of a beast. </text>
        <text>

        <text>
        </text>
        <text>&#8226; It is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>&#8226; It gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet if it doesn&#8217;t have it already. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>&#8226; It understands the languages you can speak when you create it, but it can&#8217;t speak. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>&#8226; If you are the target of a melee attack and the servant is within 5 feet of the attacker, you can use your reaction to command the servant to respond, using its reaction to make a melee attack against the attacker. </text>
        <text>	The servant obeys your orders to the best of its ability. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own. </text>
        <text>	If the servant is killed, it can be returned to life via normal means, such as with the revivify spell. In addition, over the course of a long rest, you can repair a slain servant if you have access to its body. It returns to life with 1 hit point at the end of the rest. If the servant is beyond recovery, you can build a new one with one week of work (eight hours each day) and 1,000 gp of raw materials. </text>

        <text>	An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</text>

Other storm heralds hone their craft in elite lodges in regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the world&#8217;s end, or deep in the hottest deserts.</text>

        <text>Spell Slots:</text>

        <text>	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</text>

You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
        <text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>

Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</text>

        <text>The College of Glamour is the home of bards who mastered their craft in the vibrant realm of the Feywild or under the tutelage of someone who dwelled there. Tutored by satyrs, eladrin, and other fey, these bards learn to use their magic to delight and captivate others. </text>
        <text>	The bards of this college are regarded with a mixture of awe and fear. Their performances are the stuff of legend. The bards of this college are so eloquent that a speech or song that one of them performs can cause captors to release the bard unharmed and can lull a furious dragon into complacency. The same magic that allows them to quell beasts can also bend minds. Villainous bards of this college can leech off a community for weeks, abusing their magic to turn their hosts into thralls. Heroic bards of this college instead use this power to gladden the downtrodden and undermine oppressors.</text>

        <text>When you join the College of Glamour at 3rd level, you gain the ability to weave a song of fey magic that imbues your allies with vigor and speed. </text>
        <text>	As a bonus action, you can expend a use of Bardic Inspiration to grant yourself a wondrous appearance. When you do so, choose a number of allies you can see and who can see you within 60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each of them gains 5 temporary hit points. When a creature gains these temporary hit points, it can immediately use its reaction to move up to its speed, without provoking opportunity attacks.</text>
        <text>	The number of temporary hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 8 at 5th level, 11 at 10th level, and 14 at 15th level.</text>

        <text>	If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to inspire wonder in your audience by singing, reciting a poem, or dancing. At the end of the performance, choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who watched and listened to all of it, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be charmed by you.

This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies. </text>

        <name>Bard College: College of Lore</name>
        <text>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.</text>
        <text>	The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.</text>
        <text>	The college&#8217;s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.</text>

        <name>Bard College: College of Satire</name>
        <text>Bards of the College of Satire are called jesters. They use lowbrow stories, daring acrobatics, and cutting jokes to entertain audiences, ranging from the crowds in a rundown dockside pub to the nobles of a king&#8217;s royal court. Where other bards seek forgotten lore or tales of epic bravery, jesters ferret out embarrassing and hilarious stories of all kinds. Whether telling the ribald tale of a brawny stable hand&#8217;s affair with an aged duchess or a mocking satire of a paladin of Helm&#8217;s cloying innocence, a jester never lets taste, social decorum, or shame get in the way of a good laugh.</text>
        <text>	While jesters are masters of puns, jokes, and verbal barbs, they are much more than just comic relief. They are expected to mock and provoke, taking advantage of how even the most powerful folk are expected by tradition to endure a jester&#8217;s barbs with good humor. This expectation allows a jester to serve as a critic or a voice of reason when others are too intimidated to speak the truth.</text>
        <text>	For the duchess with a taste for strapping young laborers, such tales might serve to warn the targets of her affections and force her to change her ways for lack of willing partners. Striking back at the jester only ruins her already damaged reputation, and might provide the best evidence that the jester&#8217;s satires have hit their mark. But if she is kind and generous to her conquests, the jokes and stories cast her as a kind of folk hero, while drawing even more potential partners to her.</text>
        <text>	Jesters are loyal to only one cause: the pursuit and propagation of the truth. They use their comedy and innocuous appearance to break down social barriers and expose corruption, incompetence, and stupidity among the rich and powerful. Whether revealing a con artist&#8217;s treachery or exposing a baron&#8217;s plans for war as driven by greed and bloodlust, a jester serves as the conscience of a realm.</text>
        <text>	Jesters adventure to safeguard the common folk and to undermine the plans of the rich, powerful, and arrogant. Their magic bolsters allies&#8217; spirits while casting doubt into foes&#8217; minds. Among bards, jesters are unmatched acrobats, and their ability to tumble, dodge, leap, and climb makes them slippery opponents in battle.</text>

        <name>Bard College: College of Swords</name>
        <text>Bards of the College of Swords are called blades, and they entertain through daring feats of weapon prowess. Blades perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock combats. But though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors in their own right.</text>
        <text>	Their talent with weapons inspires many blades to lead double lives. One blade might use a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination, robbery, and blackmail. Other blades strike at the wicked, bringing justice to bear against the cruel and powerful. Most troupes are happy to accept a blade&#8217;s talent for the excitement it adds to a performance, but few entertainers fully trust a blade in their ranks.</text>
        <text>	Blades who abandon lives as entertainers have often run into trouble that makes maintaining their secret activities impossible. A blade caught stealing or engaging in vigilante justice is too great a liability for most troupes. With their weapon skills and magic, these blades either take up work as enforcers for thieves&#8217; guilds or strike out on their own as adventurers.</text>

        <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the cleric spell list.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Cantrips:</text>
        <text>	At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn an additional cleric cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Preparing and Casting Spells:</text>
        <text>	The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text>	You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
        <text>	For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&#8217;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
        <text>	You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
        <text>	Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
        <text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
        <text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Ritual Casting:</text>
        <text>	You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spellcasting Focus:</text>
        <text>	You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</text>

The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can transform from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities quest to search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items.

To desecrate the peace of the dead is an abomination. Deities of the grave include Kelemvor, Wee Jas, the ancestral spirits of the Undying Court, Hades, Anubis, and Osiris. Followers of these deities seek to put wandering spirits to rest, destroy the undead, and ease the suffering of the dying. Their magic also allows them to stave off death for a time, particularly for a person who still has some great work to accomplish in the world. This is a delay of death, not a denial of it, for death will eventually get its due.</text>

        <text>	The ideal of order is obedience to the law above all else, rather than to a specific individual or the passing influence of emotion or popular rule. Clerics of order are typically concerned with how things are done, rather than whether an action&#8217;s results are just. Following the law and obeying its edicts is critical, especially when it benefits these clerics and their deities.</text>
        <text>	More importantly, law establishes hierarchies. Those selected by the law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must do so to the best of their ability. In this manner, law creates an intricate web of obligations that allows society to forge order and security in a chaotic multiverse. </text>

These gods believe that a strong shield and a suit of armor is the best defense against evil, second only to a stout mace on hand to respond to any attacks in kind. Deities who grant this domain include Helm, Ilmater, Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, St. Cuthbert, Paladine, Dol Dorn, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Yondalla, Athena, and Odin. </text>

Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and Kiri-Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of conquest and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet).

For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.</text>

        <text>Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the druid spell list. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Cantrips:</text>
        <text>	At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn an additional druid cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Preparing and Casting Spells:</text>
        <text>	The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text>	You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
        <text>	For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&#8217;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
        <text>	You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
        <text>	Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
        <text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
        <text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Ritual Casting:</text>
        <text>	You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spellcasting Focus:</text>
        <text>	You can use a druidic focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</text>

        <name>Wild Shape</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
        <text>	Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table (Player&#8217;s Handbook, p. 66).</text>
        <text>	At 2nd level, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn&#8217;t have a flying or swimming speed. At 4th level, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower that doesn&#8217;t have a flying speed. At 8th level, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1 or lower.</text>
        <text>	You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</text>
        <text>	While you are transformed, the following rules apply.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>&#8226; Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature&#8217;s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can&#8217;t use them.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>&#8226; When you transform, you assume the beast&#8217;s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn&#8217;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren&#8217;t knocked unconscious.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>&#8226; You can&#8217;t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn&#8217;t break your concentration on a spell you&#8217;ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you&#8217;ve already cast.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>&#8226; You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can&#8217;t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>&#8226; You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature&#8217;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn&#8217;t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can&#8217;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. </text>

        <text>	When you gain the Wild Shape feature at 2nd level, you are deeply familiar with three beasts of your choice and can transform into them. </text>
        <text>	To choose the three beast shapes, you first need to determine whether your druid grew up in a temperate or a tropical region, consulting with your DM. Then refer to the Common Beast Shapes table that corresponds to the region you selected. That table lists the beasts you can choose from, based on your druid level. The table presents the animals that a druid is most likely to have seen as a novice, to have learned about through mystic research, or to have a special affinity with. </text>
        <text>	Each time you gain a druid level later, you can choose one more beast shape from the same table you used at 2nd level.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Gaining Beast Shapes:</text>
        <text>	In addition to the beast shapes you gain for free when you level up, you can acquire new shapes on your adventures. Do you see a dinosaur, a saber-toothed tiger, a giant eagle, or some other exotic critter that you want to turn into? This rule gives you a method for learning how to do so. It requires you to abide by the limitations in the Wild Shape feature (see the Beast Shapes table in the Player&#8217;s Handbook, page 66). </text>
        <text>	When you see a beast whose shape you&#8217;d like to learn, you have two options: </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Observation: </text>
        <text>	You learn the beast&#8217;s shape after observing its behavior for at least 1 hour and succeeding on an Intelligence (Nature) check with a DC equal to 10 + the beast&#8217;s challenge rating. For this observation period, your vantage point&#8212;whether physical or magical&#8212; must be within 150 feet of the beast. If you previously spent at least 1 hour reading a scholarly work about the creature, you have advantage on the check. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Interaction: </text>
        <text>	You learn the beast&#8217;s shape after interacting with it peacefully for 10 minutes and succeeding on a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check with a DC equal to 10 + the beast&#8217;s challenge rating. For this interaction period, you must be within 15 feet of the beast, and if you spend at least a minute petting it, you have advantage on the check. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>	Either of these options can be assisted by magic. For example, divination magic can be used to provide safe observation of a dangerous animal, and a spell like animal friendship can lay the groundwork for peaceful interaction.</text>

        <text>Druids who are members of the Circle of Dreams hail from regions that have strong ties to the Feywild and its dreamlike realms. The druids&#8217; guardianship of the natural world makes for a natural alliance between them and good-aligned fey. These druids seek to fill the world with dreamy wonder. Their magic mends wounds and brings joy to downcast hearts, and the realms they protect are gleaming, fruitful places where dream and reality blend together and where the weary can find rest.</text>

        <text>	As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 120 feet of you and spend a number of those dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them together. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the total. The target also gains 1 temporary hit point per die spent.</text>

        <name>Druid Circle: Circle of Spores</name>
        <text>Druids of the Circle of Spores find beauty in decay. They see within mold and other fungi the ability to transform lifeless material into abundant, albeit somewhat strange, life.</text>
        <text>	These druids believe that life and death are portions of a grand cycle, with one leading to the other and then back again. Death is not the end of life, but instead a change of state that sees life shift into a new form.</text>
        <text>	Druids of this circle have a complex relationship with the undead. Unlike most other druids, they see nothing inherently wrong with undeath, which they consider to be a companion to life and death. However, these druids believe that the natural cycle is healthiest when each segment of it is vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to replace all life with undeath, or avoid passing to a final rest, violate the cycle and must be thwarted.</text>

        <text>Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd commune with the spirits of nature, especially the spirits of beasts and the fey, and call to those spirits for aid. These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to the fey. Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds.</text>
        <text>	Members of this circle become adventurers to oppose forces that threaten their charges or to seek knowledge and power that will help them safeguard their charges better. Wherever these druids go, the spirits of the wilderness are with them.</text>

        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to call forth nature spirits to influence the world around you. As a bonus action, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit creates an aura in a 30-foot radius around that point. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents.</text>
        <text>	As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60 feet to a point you can see.</text>

        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Hawk Spirit: The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit&#8217;s aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Unicorn Spirit: The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit&#8217;s aura. In addition, if you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores hit points to any creature inside or outside the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also regains hit points equal to your druid level.</text>

        <text>An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of their most elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.</text>

Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter&#8217;s reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.</text>

        <text>	Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can&#8217;t be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.</text>
        <text>	You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.</text>

        <text>	A Purple Dragon Knight inspires greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. The mere presence of a knight in a hamlet is enough to cause some orcs and bandits to seek easier prey. A lone knight is a skilled warrior, but a knight leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.</text>
        <text>	A knight prefers to lead through deeds, not words. As a knight spearheads an attack, the knight&#8217;s actions can awaken reserves of courage and conviction in allies that they never suspected they had.</text>

You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</text>
        <text>	Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature&#8217;s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</text>
        <text>	Ki save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>

Sometimes the members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other monasteries are more like thieves&#8217; guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else who can pay their fees. Regardless of their methods, the heads of these monasteries expect the unquestioning obedience of their students.</text>

The drunken master&#8217;s erratic stumbles conceal a carefully executed dance of blocks, parries, advances, attacks, and retreats.</text>

        <name>Disciple of the Elements (Way of the Four Elements)</name>
        <text>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki points each time you use it.</text>
        <text>	You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and one other elemental discipline of your choice, which are detailed in the "Elemental Disciplines" section below. You learn one additional elemental discipline of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</text>
        <text>	Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one elemental discipline that you already know with a different discipline.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Casting Elemental Spells. Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don&#8217;t need to provide material components for it.</text>
        <text>	Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands does. The spell&#8217;s level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast burning hands, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline&#8217;s base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).</text>
        <text>	The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level. At 5th level, you may spend up to 3 ki points; this increases to 4 ki points at 9th level, 5 at 13th level, and 6 at 17th level.</text>

        <text>	A kensei sees a weapon in much the same way a calligrapher or painter regards a pen or brush.

Each of these weapons can be any simple or martial weapon that lacks the heavy and special properties. The longbow is also a valid choice. You gain proficiency with these weapons if you don&#8217;t already have it. Weapons of the chosen types are monk weapons for you. Many of this tradition&#8217;s features work only with your kensei weapons. When you reach 6th, 11th, and 17th level in this class, you can choose another type of weapon&#8212;either melee or ranged&#8212;to be a kensei weapon for you, following the criteria above. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Agile Parry:  If you make an unarmed strike as part of the Attack action on your turn and are holding a kensei weapon, you can use it to defend yourself if it is a melee weapon. You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, while the weapon is in your hand and you aren&#8217;t incapacitated. </text>
        <text>

        <text>Kensei Shot: You can use a bonus action on your turn to make your ranged attacks with a kensei weapon more deadly. When you do so, any target you hit with a ranged attack using a kensei weapon takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon&#8217;s type. You retain this benefit until the end of the current turn.</text>

        <text>&#8226; An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.</text>

        </text>
        <text>&#8226; Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.</text>

        <name>Psionics</name>
        <text>As a student of psionics, you can master and use psionic talents and disciplines. Psionics is a special form of magic use, distinct from spellcasting. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Psionic Talents: </text>
        <text>	A psionic talent is a minor psionic effect you have mastered. At 1st level, you know one psionic talent of your choice. You learn additional talents of your choice at higher levels. You learn an additional talent at 3rd, 10th, and 17th level. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Psionic Disciplines: </text>
        <text>	A psionic discipline is a rigid set of mental exercises that allows a mystic to manifest psionic power. A mystic masters only a few disciplines at a time. </text>
        <text>	At 1st level, you know one psionic discipline of your choice. You learn an additional discipline of your choice at 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level.</text>
        <text>	In addition, whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one discipline you know with a different one of your choice. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Psi Points: </text>
        <text>	You have an internal reservoir of energy that can be devoted to psionic disciplines you know. This energy is represented by psi points. Each psionic discipline describes effects you can create with it by spending a certain number of psi points. A psionic talent requires no psi points. </text>
        <text>	The number of psi points you have is based on your mystic level: 4 points at 1st level, 6 at 2nd, 14 at 3rd, 17 at 4th, 27 at 5th, 32 at 6th, 38 at 7th, 44 at 8th, 57 at 9th, 64 at 10th, and 71 at 18th.. The number shown for your level is your psi point maximum. Your psi point total returns to its maximum when you finish a long rest. The number of psi points you have can&#8217;t go below 0 or over your maximum. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Psi Limit: </text>
        <text>	Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit on the number of psi points you can spend to activate a psionic discipline. The limit is based on your mystic level; at 1st level, your psi limit is 2, and it increases to 3 at 3rd, 5 at 5th, 6 at 7th, and 7 at 9th.  For example, as a 3rd-level mystic, you can spend no more than 3 psi points on a discipline each time you use it, no matter how many psi points you have. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Psychic Focus: </text>
        <text>	You can focus psionic energy on one of your psionic disciplines to draw ongoing benefits from it. As a bonus action, you can choose one of your psionic disciplines and gain its psychic focus benefit, which is detailed in that discipline&#8217;s description. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit. </text>
        <text>	You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn&#8217;t limit your ability to use other disciplines. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Psionic Ability: </text>
        <text>	Intelligence is your psionic ability for your psionic disciplines. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psionic discipline or when making an attack roll with one. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Discipline save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Discipline attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>

        <text>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Preparing and Casting Spells:</text>
        <text>	The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text>	You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier+half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
        <text>	For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&#8217;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
        <text>	You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. </text>

        <text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
        <text>	Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
        <text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
        <text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spellcasting Focus:</text>
        <text>	You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</text>

        <text>The Oath of Conquest calls to paladins who seek glory in battle and the subjugation of their enemies. It isn&#8217;t enough for these paladins to establish order. They must crush the forces of chaos. Sometimes called knight tyrants or iron mongers, those who swear this oath gather into grim orders that serve gods or philosophies of war and well-ordered might.</text>
        <text>	Some of these paladins go so far as to consort with the powers of the Nine Hells, valuing the rule of law over the balm of mercy. The archdevil Bel, warlord of Avernus, counts many of these paladins&#8212;called hell knights&#8212;as his most ardent supporters. Hell knights cover their armor with trophies taken from fallen enemies, a grim warning to any who dare oppose them and the decrees of their lords. These knights are often most fiercely resisted by other paladins of this oath, who believe that the hell knights have wandered too far into darkness.</text>

        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Devotion</name>
        <text>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods&#8217; tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels &#8212; the perfect servants of good &#8212; as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms. </text>

        <text>Courage: Never fear to act, though caution is wise.</text>
        <text>

        <text>Compassion: Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Honor: Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Duty: Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you. </text>

        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Redemption</name>
        <text>The Oath of Redemption sets a paladin on a difficult path, one that requires a holy warrior to use violence only as a last resort. Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk. These paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning their foes to the light, and they slay their enemies only when such a deed will clearly save other lives. Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers.</text>
        <text>	While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. Redeemers know that undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently evil. Against such foes, paladins who swear this oath bring the full wrath of their weapons and spells to bear. Yet the redeemers still pray that, one day, even creatures of wickedness will invite their own redemption.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Tenets of Redemption:</text>
        <text>	The tenets of the Oath of Redemption hold a paladin to a high standard of peace and justice.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Peace: Violence is a weapon of last resort. Diplomacy and understanding are the paths to long-lasting peace.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Innocence: All people begin life in an innocent state, and it is their environment or the influence of dark forces that drives them to evil. By setting the proper example, and working to heal the wounds of a deeply flawed world, you can set anyone on a righteous path.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Patience: Change takes time. Those who have walked the path of the wicked must be given reminders to keep them honest and true. Once you have planted the seed of righteousness in a creature, you must work day after day to allow it to survive and then flourish.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Wisdom: Your heart and mind must stay clear, for eventually you will be forced to admit defeat. While every creature can be redeemed, some are so far along the path of evil that you have no choice but to end their lives for the greater good. Any such action must be carefully weighed and the consequences fully understood, but once you have made the decision, follow through with it knowing your path is just.</text>

        <text>The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves and the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things &#8212; leaves, antlers, or flowers &#8212; to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world. </text>

        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of the Crown</name>
        <text>The Oath of the Crown is sworn to the ideals of civilization, be it the spirit of a nation, fealty to a sovereign, or service to a deity of law and rulership. The paladins who swear this oath dedicate themselves to serving society and, in particular, the laws that hold society together. These paladins are the watchful guardians on the walls, standing against the chaotic tides of barbarism that threaten to tear down all that civilization has built, and are commonly known as guardians, exemplars, or sentinels. Often, paladins who swear this oath are members of an order of knighthood in service to a nation or sovereign, and undergo their oath as part of their admission to the order&#8217;s ranks.</text>

        </text>
        <text>Tenets of the Crown:</text>
        <text>	The tenets of the Oath of the Crown are often set by the sovereign to which their oath is sworn, but generally emphasize the following tenets.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Law: The law is paramount. It is the mortar that holds the stones of civilization together, and it must be respected.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Loyalty: Your word is your bond. Without loyalty, oaths and laws are meaningless.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Courage: You must be willing to do what needs to be done for the sake of order, even in the face of overwhelming odds. If you don&#8217;t act, then who will?</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Responsibility: You must deal with the consequences of your actions, and you are responsible for fulfilling your duties and obligations. </text>

        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Treachery</name>
        <text>The Oath of Treachery is the path followed by paladins who have forsworn other oaths or who care only for their own power and survival. Commonly known as blackguards, these profane warriors are faithful only to themselves. Anyone desperate enough to follow one of these paladins does so because, while deceitful, these paladins command great power. Those who follow them without falling prey to their treachery hope to indulge in wanton violence and accumulate great treasure. </text>
        <text>	Many of these paladins pay homage to demon lords, especially Grazz&#8217;t and Orcus. Even the Lords of Hell are loath to ally with these champions of chaos, but sometimes Baalzebul and Glasya find a kindred spirit in a blackguard&#8217;s penchant for double dealing and treachery. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Fallen Paladins: </text>
        <text>	The Oath of Treachery is an option for the paladin who has strayed from another Sacred Oath or who has rejected the traditional paladin life. This option exists alongside the Oathbreaker in the Dungeon Master&#8217;s Guide. DMs are free to use either option to model villainous or fallen paladins. </text>
        <text>	If you switch to this oath from another one, replace all of the previous oath&#8217;s features with the features of this one, and if you renounce this oath, replace its features with the features of the new one. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Tenets of Treachery: </text>
        <text>	A paladin who embraces the Oath of Treachery owes allegiance to no one. There are no tenets of this oath, for it lacks any substance. Those who are unfortunate enough to have close contact with blackguards have observed that a blackguard&#8217;s overwhelming concern is power and safety, especially if both can be obtained at the expense of others. </text>

        <text>As an action, you create a visual illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. The illusion looks exactly like you; it is silent; it is your size, is insubstantial, and doesn&#8217;t occupy its space; and it is unaffected by attacks and damage. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but the illusion must remain within 120 feet of you. </text>
        <text>	For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion&#8217;s space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how uncanny the illusion is.</text>

        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Vengeance</name>
        <text>The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves&#8217; guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside &#8212; at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins &#8212; sometimes called avengers or dark knights &#8212; their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Tenets of Vengeance:</text>
        <text>	The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Fight the Greater Evil: Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil. I choose the greater evil. </text>

        </text>
        <text>No Mercy for the Wicked: Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not. </text>

        </text>
        <text>By Any Means Necessary: My qualms can&#8217;t get in the way of exterminating my foes. </text>

        <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spell Slots:</text>
        <text>	The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text>	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:</text>
        <text>	You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</text>
        <text>	You learn an additional ranger spell of your choice at each odd numbered level thereafter. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
        <text>	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
        <text>	Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
        <text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
        <text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>

Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. Add your proficiency bonus to the beast&#8217;s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals the hit point number in its stat block or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher. Like any creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest to regain hit points.</text>
        <text>	The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn&#8217;t take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action.</text>
        <text>	If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. The beast never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.</text>
        <text>	While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</text>
        <text>	If the beast dies, you can obtain a new companion by spending 8 hours magically bonding with a beast that isn&#8217;t hostile to you and that meets the requirements.</text>

        <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spell Slots: </text>
        <text>	The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. </text>
        <text>	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher: </text>
        <text>	You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list. </text>
        <text>	At each odd level, you learn an additional ranger spell of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. </text>
        <text>	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spellcasting Ability: </text>
        <text>	Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier </text>
        <text>

        <name>Primeval Awareness</name>
        <text>Beginning at 3rd level, your mastery of ranger lore allows you to establish a powerful link to beasts and to the land around you. </text>
        <text>	You have an innate ability to communicate with beasts, and they recognize you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action, and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it to not attack. </text>
        <text>	You cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked within the past 10 minutes. </text>
        <text>	Additionally, you can attune your senses to determine if any of your favored enemies lurk nearby. By spending 1 uninterrupted minute in concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), you can sense whether any of your favored enemies are present within 5 miles of you. This feature reveals which of your favored enemies are present, their numbers, and the creatures&#8217; general direction and distance (in miles) from you. </text>
        <text>	If there are multiple groups of your favored enemies within range, you learn this information for each group.</text>

        <text>At 3rd level, you learn to use your magic to create a powerful bond with a creature of the natural world. </text>
        <text>	With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 50 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your faithful companion. You normally select you companion from among the following animals: an ape, a black bear, a boar, a giant badger, a giant weasel, a mule, a panther, or a wolf. However, your DM might pick one of these animals for you, based on the surrounding terrain and on what types of creatures would logically be present in the area. </text>
        <text>	At the end of the 8 hours, your animal companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion&#8217;s Bond ability. You can have only one animal companion at a time. </text>
        <text>	If your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth your companion&#8217;s spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body. </text>
        <text>	If you use this ability to return a former animal companion to life while you have a current animal companion, your current companion leaves you and is replaced by the restored companion.</text>

        <text>	When using your Natural Explorer feature, you and your animal companion can both move stealthily at a normal pace. </text>
        <text>	Your animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, an animal companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls. </text>
        <text>	Your animal companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws. </text>
        <text>	For each level you gain after 3rd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly. </text>
        <text>	Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion&#8217;s abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

        <text>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to summon a creature made from shadow magic to serve you. As a bonus action on your turn, you conjure or dismiss your shadow familiar, which takes the form of a spectral creature. You choose the form you can create when you first select this subclass.</text>
        <text>	When you conjure your shadow familiar, it appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. As long as it is conjured, you can forgo one or more of your attacks when you use the Attack action to have your shadow familiar move and make attacks of its own, which use your Ranger spell attack modifier for their attack rolls. Your shadow familiar cannot move farther than 120 feet away from you.</text>
        <text>	The three forms you can choose from are listed below:</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Cat: Whenever you forgo an attack, you can have the cat move up to 30 feet and attack a creature. On a hit, the attack deals 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier slashing damage, and the next attack made against that creature has advantage on the attack roll.</text>
        <text>	As an action, you can expend a ranger spell slot to infuse the cat&#8217;s claws with poison and have it leap onto a target within 30 feet of it. That creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Ranger spell save DC or be poisoned until the end of your next turn and take 2d8 poison damage for a 1st level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Raven: Whenever you forgo an attack, you can have the raven fly up to 45 feet and attack a creature. On a hit, the attack deals 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier piercing damage.</text>
        <text>	As an action, you can expend a ranger spell slot to infuse the raven with lightning and have it travel along a line 5 feet wide and 20 feet long. Each creature in that line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 lightning damage for a 1st level spell slot, plus 1d6 for each spell level higher than 1st.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Wolf: Whenever you forgo an attack, you can have the wolf move up to 30 feet and attack a creature. On a hit, the attack deals 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier piercing damage, and the target has disadvantage on its next attack roll.</text>
        <text>	As an action, you can expend a ranger spell slot to infuse the wolf with primal ferocity and have it release a piercing howl. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of the wolf gains 1d6 temporary hit points for a 1st level spell slot, plus 1d6 for each spell level higher than 1st. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute.</text>

        <text>During your rogue training you learned thieves&#8217; cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves&#8217; cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</text>
        <text>	In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves&#8217; guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</text>

        <name>Spellcasting (Arcane Trickster)</name>
        <text>When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Cantrips: You learn three cantrips: mage hand and two other cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn another wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spell Slots: The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text>	For example. if you know the 1st-level spell charm person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast charm person using either slot. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher: You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells on the wizard spell list. </text>
        <text>	You learn one additional spell at 4th, 7th, 8th, 10th, 11th, 13th, 14th, 16th, 19th, and 20th level. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this c1ass. you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. </text>
        <text>	The spells you learn at 8th. 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic. </text>
        <text>	Whenever you gain a level in this c1ass, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you&#8217;re replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spellcasting Ability: Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spell save DC = 8+your proficiency bonus+your Intelligence modifier </text>

        <name>Rune Lore</name>
        <text>At 1st level, you learn the basics of scribing runes, and are able to activate a master rune&#8217;s full range of properties when you are properly attuned to it.</text>
        <text>	The first rune you master is the rune you found and presented to your tutor to qualify for this prestige class. Your entrance to the class includes the process of mastering that rune&#8217;s secrets.</text>

        <name>Runic Magic</name>
        <text>Runes can make use of your own magical power to augment some of their effects. You gain a number of spell slots as specified on the Rune Scribe table, but this prestige class does not grant spells known. Instead, as a rune scribe, you can expend your spell slots to empower runes. </text>
        <text>	For the purpose of multiclassing, to determine your total spell slots, add your levels in rune scribe to your levels in classes that grant you the Spellcasting feature. For example, if you are a rune scribe 4/wizard 6, you would have the spell slots of a 10th-level character, in addition to having the cantrips and spellbook of a 6th-level wizard.</text>

        <text>Your continuing study of runic magic allows you to recreate the secrets of new runes without first needing to uncover them. At 2nd, 3rd, and 5th level, choose a rare rune. You can attune to that rune even if you do not possess the master rune for it.</text>
        <text>	In order to attune to a rune in this manner, you must spend a short rest doing nothing but meditating on the rune. At the end of the short rest, you are attuned to the rune. You are considered to always have the rune on your person for the purpose of determining whether you can use its features.</text>

        <text>An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Cantrips:</text>
        <text>	At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spell Slots:</text>
        <text>	The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text>	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:</text>
        <text>	You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</text>
        <text>	You learn an additional sorcerer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
        <text>	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
        <text>	Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
        <text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
        <text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>

        <name>Sorcerous Origin: Divine Soul</name>
        <text>Sometimes the spark of magic that fuels a sorcerer comes from a divine source that glimmers within the soul. Having such a blessed soul is a sign that your innate magic might come from a distant but powerful familial connection to a divine being. Perhaps your ancestor was an angel, transformed into a mortal and sent to fight in a god&#8217;s name. Or your birth might align with an ancient prophecy, marking you as a servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of divine magic.</text>
        <text>	A Divine Soul, with a natural magnetism, is seen as a threat ny some religious hierarchies. As an outsider who commands sacred power, a Divine Soul can undermine an existing order by claiming a direct tie to the divine.</text>
        <text>	In some cultures, only those who can claim the power of a Divine Soul may command religious power. In these lands, ecclesiastical positions are dominated by a few bloodlines and preserved over generations.</text>

        <text>Your power draws from the immortal flame that fuels the legendary phoenix. You or your ancestors perhaps rendered a phoenix a great service, or you were born in its presence. Whatever the cause, a shard of the phoenix&#8217;s power dwells within you.</text>
        <text>	That power is a mixed blessing. Like the mythical creature, you can invoke fiery energy and gain the ability to cheat death itself. This power comes at a cost. The fire within you seethes, demanding to be unleashed. You sometimes find yourself absentmindedly feeding fires. You can&#8217;t bear to allow a fire to sputter out. You feel most comfortable while holding a lit torch or sitting in front of a campfire.</text>
        <text>	More importantly, this gift comes with no special protection from fire. You are as vulnerable as any other creature to fiery magic, including your own. Phoenix sorcerers can use their powers to pull themselves back from the brink of death, and all too often their own, rash nature or reliance on destructive magic is what puts them there in the first place.</text>
        <text>	Such sorcerers are wanderers by necessity. The volatile nature of their magic makes other folk nervous. If a fire breaks out in town, a phoenix sorcerer had best flee, whether guilty or not. Fire is a dangerous force, and phoenix sorcerers have a reputation (deserved or not) for reckless behavior, confident that the essence of the phoenix can save them.</text>

        <text>&#8226; You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.</text>

you.</text>

        <text>The power of water is the strength of flexibility, resilience, and a relentless nature. Water parts to allow a ship to sail over it or a diver to plunge into it, but their passing leaves no mark. Water flowing down a mountain reaches the sea. It might bend and turn across valleys and down hillsides, but it slowly and steadily returns to the waves. Those whose souls are touched by the power of elemental water command a similar power.</text>
        <text>	Your heritage ties to powerful creatures of the sea, such as nereids, the lords of the merfolk, and elemental powers. Like a river, you feel the call of the ocean. The call is ever present in your heart, and you are never completely at peace until you are near the sea.</text>

        <text>	Once per turn when you cast a spell, you can trigger the curse if that spell deals cold or lightning damage to the cursed target or forces it to move.

        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Cold Damage: If the affected target takes cold damage from your spell, the target&#8217;s speed is also reduced by 15 feet until the end of your next turn. If the spell already reduces the target&#8217;s speed, use whichever reduction is greater.</text>
        <text>

        <text>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the warlock spell list. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Cantrips:</text>
        <text>	You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn an additional warlock cantrip of your choice at 4th level, and another at 10th level. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spell Slots:</text>
        <text>	The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
        <text>	For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:</text>
        <text>	At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</text>
        <text>	You learn an additional warlock spell at 2nd through 9th level, and at every odd level thereafter. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what&#8217;s shown in the table&#8217;s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</text>
        <text>	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
        <text>	Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
        <text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
        <text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spellcasting Focus:</text>
        <text>	You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.</text>

        <name>Otherworldly Patron: The Hexblade</name>
        <text>You have made your pact with a mysterious entity from the Shadowfell&#8212;a force that manifests in sentient magic weapons carved from the stuff of shadow. The mighty sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these weapons, several of which have spread across the multiverse over the ages. The shadowy force behind these weapons can offer power to warlocks who form pacts with it. Many hexblade warlocks create weapons that emulate those formed in the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, content to weave the dark magic of that plane into their spellcasting.</text>
        <text>	Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged the first of these weapons, many sages speculate that she and the force are one and that the weapons, along with hexblade warlocks, are tools she uses to manipulate events on the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends.</text>

        <name>Hexblade&#8217;s Curse (Hexblade)</name>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:</text>

        <text>	The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest.

The Raven Queen watches over the world, anticipating each creature&#8217;s death and ensuring that it meets its end at the proscribed time and place. As the ruler of the Shadowfell, she dwells in a decayed, dark reflection of the world. Her ability to reach into the world is limited. Thus, she turns to mortal warlocks to serve her will. Warlocks sworn to the Raven Queen receive visions and whispers from her in their dreams, sending them on quests and warning them of impending dangers.</text>
        <text>	The Raven Queen&#8217;s followers are expected to serve her will in the world. She concerns herself with ensuring that those fated to die pass from the world as expected, and bids her agents to defeat those who seek to cheat death through undeath or other imitations of immortality. She hates intelligent undead and expects her followers to strike them down, whereas mindless undead such as skeletons and zombies are little more than stumbling automatons in her eyes.</text>

        <text>	While the raven is perched on your shoulder, you gain darkvision with a range of 30 feet and a bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) score and to Wisdom (Perception) checks. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier. While perched on your shoulder, the raven can&#8217;t be targeted by any attack or other harmful effect; only you can cast spells on it; it can&#8217;t take damage; and it is incapacitated.</text>

        <text>	Additionally, undead have difficulty harming you. If an undead targets you directly with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (an undead needn&#8217;t make the save when it includes you in an area effect, such as the explosion of fireball). On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone instead of you, potentially wasting the attack or spell. On a succesful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target it with an attack or a harmful spell.</text>

        <text>Starting at 6th level, you can curse the soul of a person you slay, temporarily binding it to your service. When you slay a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter, the statistics for which are in the Monster Manual. When the specter appears, it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to attack equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0).</text>
        <text>	The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife.</text>
        <text>	Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can&#8217;t use the feature again until you finish a long rest.</text>

        <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Cantrips:</text>
        <text>	At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 4th level, and another at 10th level.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spellbook:</text>
        <text>	At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Preparing and Casting Spells:</text>
        <text>	The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text>	You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so. choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
        <text>	For example, if you&#8217;re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&#8217;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
        <text>	You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
        <text>	Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
        <text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>
        <text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Ritual Casting:</text>
        <text>	You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don&#8217;t need to have the spell prepared. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Spellcasting Focus:</text>
        <text>	You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. </text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher:</text>
        <text>	Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook.</text>

      <feature>
        <name>Spellbook</name>
        <text>The spells of 1st level and higher that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard&#8217;s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Copying a Spell into the Book:</text>
        <text>	When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</text>
        <text>	Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</text>
        <text>	For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>Replacing the Book:</text>
        <text>	You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book &#8212; for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</text>
        <text>	If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</text>
        <text>
        </text>
        <text>The Book&#8217;s Appearance:</text>
        <text>	Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</text>

The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</text>
        <text>	For example, if you&#8217;re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</text>

This reduction to your Arcane Recovery applies until you use the scroll and then finish a long rest.</text>

        <text>Lore Mastery is an arcane tradition fixated on
understanding the underlying mechanics of
magic. It is the most academic of all arcane
traditions. The promise of uncovering new
knowledge or proving (or discrediting) a theory
of magic is usually required to rouse its
practitioners from their laboratories, academies,
and archives to pursue a life of adventure.</text>
        <text>	Known as savants, followers of this tradition
are a bookish lot who see beauty and mystery in
the application of magic. The results of a spell
are less interesting to them than the process that
creates it. Some savants take a haughty attitude
toward those who follow a tradition focused on a
single school of magic, seeing them as provincial
and lacking the sophistication needed to master
true magic. Other savants are generous teachers, knowledge and good humor.</text>

        <name>Arcane Ward (School of Abjuration)</name>
        <text>Starting at 2nd level, you can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell&#8217;s magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to twice your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.</text>
        <text>	While the ward has 0 hit points, it can&#8217;t absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.</text>
        <text>	Once you create the ward, you can&#8217;t create it again until you finish a long rest.</text>

        <name>Arcane Tradition: School of Invention</name>
        <text>The School of Invention claims credit for inventing the other schools of magic&#8212;a claim other wizards find absurd. Wizards of this school push magic to its limits. They stretch the known laws of arcane power and strive to reveal important truths about the nature of the multiverse.</text>
        <text>	Adherents of this school believe that innovation is best served through experimentation. They have a reputation for acting first, thinking second. Most wizards are scholars who have mastered their craft through careful study, rigorous practice, and endless hours of repetition. These wizards would rather throw spells together and see what happens.</text>
        <text>	Many wizards of this tradition are gnomes, alchemists, or both, and they take pride in the magic-infused armor they don. The armor not only provides protection, but it is also designed to help the wizard channel magic in unpredictable ways.</text>
        <text>	Wizards of this tradition are regarded as savants to their faces, but wizards of other traditions often think of them as lunatics.</text>

        <text>	Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with light armor and gain a suit of arcanomechanical armor&#8212;a magic item that only you can attune to. While you are attuned to it and wearing it, it grants you resistance to force damage.</text>
        <text>	The armor is light armor and provides an AC of 12 + your Dexterity modifier. It weighs 8 pounds.</text>
        <text>	You can create a new suit of it at the end of a long rest by touching a nonmagical suit of studded leather armor, which magically transforms it. Doing so removes the magic from your previous arcanomechanical armor, turning it into nonmagical studded leather.</text>

You perform a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.</text>

        <text>	Technomancers can make use of technology as both a conduit and a storage space for magic. In a campaign using the optional rules for magic item creation (see the Dungeon Master&#8217;s Guide), a technomancer might craft disposable electronic devices and smartphone apps in lieu of potions and scrolls.</text>

        <name>Arcane Tradition: Theurgy</name>
        <text>A number of deities claim arcane magic as their domain, for magic is as much a part of the fabric of the cosmos as wind, fire, lightning, and all other primal forces. Just as there are deities of the sea and gods of warfare, the arcane arts feature their own divine patrons.</text>
        <text>	Such deities often have clerics, but many gods of magic bid their followers to take up the study of wizardry. These religious magic-users follow the arcane tradition of Theurgy, and are commonly known as theurgists. Such spellcasters are as dedicated and scholarly as any other wizard, but they blend their arcane study with religious devotion.</text>

        <name>Arcane Tradition: War Magic</name>
        <text>A variety of arcane colleges specialize in training wizards for war. The tradition of War Magic blends principles of evocation and abjuration, rather than specializing in either of those schools. It teaches techniques that empower a caster&#8217;s spells, while also providing methods for a wizard to bolster their own defenses.</text>
        <text>	Followers of this tradition are known as war mages. They see their magic as both a weapon and armor, a resource superior to any flimsy piece of steel. War mages act fast in battle, using their spells to seize tactical control of a situation. Their spells strike hard, while their defensive skills foil their opponents&#8217; attempts to counterattack. War mages are also adept at turning other spellcasters&#8217; magical energy against them.</text>
        <text>	In great battles, a war mage often works with evokers, abjurers, and other types of wizards. Evokers, in particular, sometimes tease war mages for splitting their attention between offense and defense. A war mage&#8217;s typical response: "What good is being able to throw a mighty fireball if I die before I can cast it?"</text>

        <text>At 6th level, you learn to augment spells in a variety of ways. When you cast a spell with a spell slot, you can expend one additional spell slot to augment its effects for this casting, mixing the raw stuff of magic into your spell to amplify it. The effect depends on the spell slot you expend.</text>
        <text>	An additional 1st-level spell slot can increase the spell&#8217;s raw force. If you roll damage for the spell when you cast it, increase the damage against every target by 2d10 force damage. If the spell can deal damage on more than one turn, it deals this extra force damage only on the turn you cast the spell.</text>
        <text>	An additional 2nd-level spell slot can increase the spell&#8217;s range. If the spell&#8217;s range is at least 30 feet, it becomes 1 mile.</text>

        <text>Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.</text>
        <text>	The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.</text>

        <text>By 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semireality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross.</text>
        <text>	The object can&#8217;t deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.</text>

        <text>Starting at 14th level, you can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those created by other wizards. As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can&#8217;t use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.</text>
        <text>	Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.</text>

For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.</text>
